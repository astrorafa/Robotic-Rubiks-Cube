# Pocket Cube Solver using Deep Neural Networks and Approximate Value Iteration

The code presented on this folder is a keras implementation of a solver based on DeepCubeA, a solver for combinatorial puzzles developed by researchers at the University of California, Irvine. The code is divided into five scripts, where `main.py` is the script that runs the solver and tests the performance of the algorithm in estimating the heuristic function. As future work, I will use this heuristic function along with A* search for solving random instances of the 2x2x2 Rubik's cube.
