# Rubiks-Cube-Solver

This repository has code for solving the Rubik's cube. I intend on adding multiple strategies here, but for now I only have a solver based on Thistleithwaite's Algorithm. I also intend to divide the code into multiple .py scripts so there is not a lot of information on a single Jupyter Notebook.
